gn: Gon's News reader

gn is a news reader which supports NNTP protocol with simple user
interface.  It is ported to various platforms including various UNIX
or UNIX-like OS's, MS-DOS/Windows etc.

Unlike other general newsreaders,  gn can follow new articles threads
by specifying subjects.  This feature enables users to follow the
threads more easily.

gn has the feature to specifically pick up control messages as well as
other general news reader features.  It is very useful for news
system administrators.

With the attached utility--gnspool, you can retrieve unread articles
into the local spooling disks, which enables you to read/post articles when 
you are not connected to the Internet.  .newsrc determines the
articles to be retrieved by gnspool.

gn is known to run on the following platforms:
	UNIX or Unix-like OS's(SunOS,NEWS-OS,UniOS,Linux...)
	OS/2 J2.1 with OS/2 Toolkit TCP/IP for OS/2
	OS/2 with EMX
	Windows(3.1/95/NT) + Winsock
	DOS + InetBIOS, PC-NFS toolkit, PathWay, Packet, LANWorkPlace,
		PC/TCP, SLIM/TCP
	X680x0 + Human68k

On all the platforms above, gn provides the same user interface.  It
can save administrators from educating users with the use of various
news readers.  Installing gn as a standard newsreader in your network
is probably a good idea.
